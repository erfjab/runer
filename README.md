# Runner Template Repository

This repository serves as a template for running various scripts with different services, such as Git, Docker, and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Currently, it supports UV with Git and Alembic, with plans to expand support for additional services, including Docker, in the future.

> **Note:** It's a new repo, so if you find any bugs, please let me know via issues

## Script Overview

The script provided automates the installation, configuration, and management of a service. It includes functions for:

- **Checking dependencies**: Verifies the required system and Python packages are installed.
- **Cloning the repository**: Fetches the script source code from GitHub.
- **Managing the service**: Supports starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of the service.
- **Logging**: Captures both standard and error logs during execution.
- **Uninstalling the service**: Completely removes the installation, service files, and logs.


### Notes:
- **Installation**: This script installs the necessary dependencies and prepares the service for running.
- **Service Management**: Start, stop, or restart the service with systemd commands.
- **Logging**: Logs are written to a specified log file for easy tracking of service operations.
